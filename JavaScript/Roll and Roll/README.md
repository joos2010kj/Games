OBJECTIVE:
Make the ball last as long as possible.

CONTROLS:
You can change the direction of the ball with...
1) Mouse Click 
OR 
2) Brief Loud Noise (e.g. Clap, Tapping on any hard object with a fingernail, etc.)

HOW TO PLAY:
Try to lead the ball to the gap in each level and let it get to the lowest level.


NOTE:
1) Touching the bottom is fine, but touching the top leads to GAME OVER.
2) If you want to use the brief loud noise as a means of changing the ball's direction, you must ALLOW the microphone usage in the beginning. 
3) You can start the game by clicking anywhere in the canvas once it's loaded.

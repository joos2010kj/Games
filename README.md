# Games

This repo holds a collection of games I have made in Java, JavaScript, and C++.  As a passionate coder who does not like to "play" games but love to "make and develop" games, I have uploaded a series of games I have made in multiple languages to this repo.

### JAVA
1. [Cross](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Games/tree/master/Java)
    - A simplified, clone version of the classic game Frogger, Cross is a game where the player has to cross a series of disjointed platforms and get to the right-end side from the left-end side as quickly as possible using only two keys -- LEFT ARROW & RIGHT ARROW.  The clock will be ticking, the number of deaths will be recorded, and the player will be respawned in the very beginning after each death, so try to cross as quickly yet calmly as possible!
    
      CONTROLS: LEFT ARROW, RIGHT ARROW

2. [Flying Bird](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Games/tree/master/Java/Flying%20Bird)
    - A simplified, clone version of the famous mobile game Flappy Bird, Flying Bird is a game where the client has to control a bird not to hit the bricks as the bird flies onward. The control is simple as usual (just a SPACEBAR)! Score will be based on the number of blocks you successfully got past, so try to fly past as many blocks as possible!
    
        CONTROLS: SPACEBAR

3. [Mind Sweeper](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Games/tree/master/Java/Mind%20Sweeper)
    - A clone version of the famous classic game Minesweeper, Mind Sweeper requires the client to locate all the bombs in the field.  You can decide on the number of bombs you want there to be, and they will be hidden at random. Unfortunately, this game doesn't support mouse, but the control is very simple: ARROW KEYS to move across the 2D grid, SPACEBAR to reveal, SHIFT to flag the region.  
      
      CONTROLS: ARROW KEYS, SPACEBAR, SHIFT

4. [Pong Pong](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Games/tree/master/Java/Pong%20Pong)
    - A clone version of the famous classic game Ping Pong, Pong Pong is a two-player game in which each player needs to control his or her own bat.  Each time the ball gets past a bat, the owner of the other bat will gain a point. Control is simple: the left bat is controlled by the keys 'W' and 'S', which moves it up and down, respectively.  The right bat is controlled by UP and DOWN ARROW, which moves it up and down, respectively.
    
      CONTROLS: 'W', 'S', UP ARROW, DOWN ARROW

    - A clone version of the famous classic game Space Invader, Space Dominator is a game where the client needs to control the plane and shoot the bullets at the aliens coming downward from above. Aliens move frantically, so try to act fast! The plane is controlled by LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS, and bullets are shot upon pressing SPACEBAR. Of course, the aliens die on contact with a bullet.
    
      CONTROLS: LEFT ARROW, RIGHT ARROW, SPACEBAR

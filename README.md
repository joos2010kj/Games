# Games

This repo holds a collection of games I have made in Java, JavaScript, and C++.  As a passionate coder who does not like to "play" games but love to "make and develop" games, I have uploaded a series of games I have made in multiple languages to this repo.

Quick Note: All of my works written in JavaScript use p5.js library!

### JAVA
1. [Cross](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Games/tree/master/Java)
    - A simplified, clone version of the classic game Frogger, Cross is a game where the player has to cross a series of disjointed platforms and get to the right-end side from the left-end side as quickly as possible using only two keys -- LEFT ARROW & RIGHT ARROW.  The clock will be ticking, the number of deaths will be recorded, and the player will be respawned in the very beginning after each death, so try to cross as quickly yet calmly as possible!
    
      CONTROLS: LEFT ARROW, RIGHT ARROW

2. [Flying Bird](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Games/tree/master/Java/Flying%20Bird)
    - A simplified, clone version of the famous mobile game Flappy Bird, Flying Bird is a game where the client has to control a bird not to hit the bricks as the bird flies onward. The control is simple as usual (just a SPACEBAR)! Score will be based on the number of blocks you successfully got past, so try to fly past as many blocks as possible!
    
        CONTROLS: SPACEBAR

3. [Mind Sweeper](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Games/tree/master/Java/Mind%20Sweeper)
    - A clone version of the famous classic game Minesweeper, Mind Sweeper requires the client to locate all the bombs in the field.  You can decide on the number of bombs you want there to be, and they will be hidden at random. Unfortunately, this game doesn't support mouse, but the control is very simple: ARROW KEYS to move across the 2D grid, SPACEBAR to reveal, SHIFT to flag the region.  
      
      CONTROLS: ARROW KEYS, SPACEBAR, SHIFT

    - A clone version of the famous classic game Ping Pong, Pong Pong is a two-player game in which each player needs to control his or her own bat.  Each time the ball gets past a bat, the owner of the other bat will gain a point. Control is simple: the left bat is controlled by the keys 'W' and 'S', which moves it up and down, respectively.  The right bat is controlled by UP and DOWN ARROW, which moves it up and down, respectively.
    
      CONTROLS: 'W', 'S', UP ARROW, DOWN ARROW

### JAVASCRIPT

1. [Roll and Roll](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Games/tree/master/JavaScript/Roll%20and%20Roll)
    - Roll and Roll, the Game of a Rolling Ball and Ascending Platforms!

        OBJECTIVE: Make the ball last as long as possible.

        CONTROLS: You can change the direction of the ball with...

            Mouse Click OR
            Brief Loud Noise (e.g. Clap, Tapping on any hard object with a fingernail, etc.)
    
        HOW TO PLAY: Try to lead the ball to the gap in each level and let it get to the lowest level.

        NOTE:
        1) Touching the bottom is fine, but touching the top leads to GAME OVER.
        2) If you want to use the brief loud noise as a means of changing the ball's direction, you must ALLOW the microphone usage in the beginning.
        3) You can start the game by clicking anywhere in the canvas once it's loaded.

    - A clone version of the classic game Hangman, this game randomly picks a word from an array of words and lets the client take a stab at fully guessing the word right.

3. [Hide and Seek](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Games/tree/master/JavaScript/Hide%20and%20Seek)
    - Hide and Seek is a game where the client (mouse cursor) has to hide from being discovered by an in-game robot, which searches around.  As the controller of the cursor, your ultimate goal is to not be within the robot's angle of vision.  Quick note for you, clients initially tend to believe that hide behind the robot is the best, but it's actually the worst idea because the robot immediately turns around, too!
    
        CONTROLS: MOUSE
